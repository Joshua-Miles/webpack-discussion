# Webpack Discussion

* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install`
* Start the backend: `json-server --watch db.json`
* Run `npm start` in its root directory
* You should get a lot of errors
* Inside the `src` folder, you'll find the codebase for the app we built last Mod. 
* As a group, using webpacks `import` and `export` keywords, import the dependencies each file needs to make the project work.
